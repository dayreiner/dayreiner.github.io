                <h2>About Jon</h2>
                <p>I'm an infrastructure architect and senior devops manager with a focus on monitoring/trending, scaling and containerization. I'm a big fan of docker, ansible, and ELK/packetbeat.</p> 
		<p>With over fifteen years of experience in the fintech and digital agency spaces, I've helped bring multiple innovative and succesful products to market throughout my career. Outside the office, I am interested in alternative and historical photographic printing processes, primarily platinum and palladium, kallitypes and wet-plate collodion. </p>
		<p>I currently reside in the west-end of Scarborough, ON with my partner Joanne and our two children.</p>
